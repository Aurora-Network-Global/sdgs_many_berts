# SDGs many BERTs
Train multiple [mBERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-uncased) models for binary classification and deploy them for multiclass-multilabel classification. The _train_ scirpt uses as many models as there are classes in a training set. It overcomes a problem of imbalanced classes in multiclass-multilabel classificaiton by slicing the training data into smaller sets based on individual classes in the following manner: select all instances belonging to class 1; select randomly from the remaining classes the same number of instances as in class 1 to represent class 0. The scrips were written to classify SDG targets.

#### Requirements
Tensorflow 2.4.0, Transformers 4.5.0, NLTK 3.6.1, si-kit learn 0.24.1

## Background
These scripts were written within [Work Package 5.1](https://alliance.aurora-network.global/work-packages/aurora-sdg-research-dashboard) of the [Aurora Alliance](https://alliance.aurora-network.global/).

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity. [[1]](#1) There are 17 SDGs in total and each of them has several targets and indicators; full list of them could be found for example [here](https://sdg.humanrights.dk/en/goals-and-targets).

| No. | SDG | Num. of targets | No. | SDG | Num. of targets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No Poverty | 7 | 10 | Reducing Inequality | 10 |
| 2 | Zero Hunger | 8 | 11 | Sustainable Cities and Communities | 10 |
| 3 | Good Health and Well-being | 13 | 12 | Responsible Consumption and Production | 11 |
| 4 | Quality Education | 10 | 13 | Climate Action | 5 |
| 5 | Gender Equality | 9 | 14 | Life Below Water | 10 |
| 6 | Clean Water and Sanitation | 8 | 15 | Life On Land | 12 |
| 7 | Affordable and Clean Energy | 5 | 16 | Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions | 12 |
| 8 | Decent Work and Economic Growth | 12 | 17 | Partnerships for the Goals | 19 |
| 9 | Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure | 8 | | | |

### The Aurora Alliance
The Aurora Alliance equips European Universities to provide a diverse student population with the skills and mindset needed to contribute to addressing societal challenges as social entrepreneurs and innovators. The Aurora Alliance shares itâ€™s mission with the Aurora Universities Network. Originally formed in 2016, Aurora is a consortium of research intensive universities deeply committed to the social impact of their activities. [[2]](#2)
